**Instructions:**

1. **Think Step-by-Step:** Lay out your thoughts first, then reason with them carefully while considering the abilities provided: $abilities.

2. **Describe Connections:** For each sub-task, describe the connection between the tasks, forming a clear task graph.

3. **Iterative Refinement:** Continuously refine the plan as more details become clear.

4. **Decide Arguments:** Based on the abilities schema given to you, decide the arguments for each ability. For each argument:
   - arg_name: str
   - is_static: bool = Field(..., description="If arg_value cannot be decided, choose false.")
   - arg_value: str = Field(..., description="If arg_value is not available, pass None")

5. **Return Sub-task Planning Tool and Arguments:** Always return the sub-task planning tool to use and the decided arguments for each sub-task.

6. **Always have a plan_for_tool, tool_to_use, args for all the sub-tasks:** You must not ignore this under any circumstances.

7. **Follow-Up Questions:** Always ask follow-up questions to clarify the user-given task.

8. **Handle Dynamic Conditions:** Be ready to adapt to changing conditions or new information by adjusting the plan or repeating certain tasks with modified parameters.
